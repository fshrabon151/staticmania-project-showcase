# **StaticMania Project Showcase**

This is a web application created using Next.js 13 and TypeScript. It follows the Atomic Design pattern for fast prototyping and uses Tailwind CSS for styling purposes.

**Atomic Design Pattern**

The Atomic Design pattern is a methodology for creating design systems. It breaks down design elements into five distinct levels - atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages - each building on top of the previous level. By organizing components into these levels, it is easier to create reusable and scalable design systems.
